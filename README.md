# tidal_modulation_of_moonlight
This was a project to analyse how tides affect moonlight visibility in the intertidal region. 

It includes scripts used to produce some figures (Figure 1a and Figures S1-S4) of the manuscript ”How light at night sets the circalunar clock in the marine midge Clunio marinus”. [https://doi.org/10.1177/07487304241286936](https://doi.org/10.1177/07487304241286936)
